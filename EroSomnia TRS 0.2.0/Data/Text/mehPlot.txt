I realized that a man should not stray from his morality.
Someone of my education and training should not be overcome by lust in the moment.
I subsided myself to living life as a NEET and got off the train. 
A life free of consequence and responsibility isn't that bad... and I still have a lot of money left over. 
No point in being a working man when you have money in savings.
From a promising life to a NEET lifestyle. This is my blog entry.
